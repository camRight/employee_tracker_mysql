# employee_tracker_mysql


Employee Tracker is a mySQL database designed to create a relational Content Management System (CMS) that allows employees to use an easy-to-use editor to log and keep track of different employees in the database system. Using several different tables and their columns and rows allows data organization across different display types. To use this application does not require a knowledge of code.

This is a backend CMS so the information can be delivered as an API to the front-end.
